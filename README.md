## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for frontend)
- **Python 3.10+** (for backend)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for deployment)
- **PostgreSQL** (or Dockerized version)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/true-2-u-dating-network.git
cd true-2-u-dating-network
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories and populate it with the necessary keys:

### Backend `.env`:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db/true2udating
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
PI_API_KEY=your_pi_api_key
MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_message_encryption_key
```

### Frontend `.env`:
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_PI_API_KEY=your_pi_api_key
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the `backend` folder, install dependencies, and run the Flask app:
```bash
mkdir backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the `frontend` folder, install dependencies, and start the React app:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment

### Using Docker

**Step 1: Build and Start the Containers**
Navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Step 2: Access the Application**
The app will be available on `http://localhost` or your server’s IP address. The backend will be running on port 5000, while the frontend runs on port 3000 (proxied through NGINX).

### Docker Compose Overview
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines three services:
1. **Frontend**: React app containerized for production.
2. **Backend**: Flask app containerized with PostgreSQL and Pi Network SDK.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL container for data persistence.

### NGINX as a Reverse Proxy
The app uses NGINX to route traffic between the frontend and backend efficiently.
